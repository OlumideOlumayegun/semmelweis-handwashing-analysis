    "## 1. Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1840s, the Vienna General Hospital was a place of both hope and despair. While it was a leading medical institution, it was also the site of a devastating phenomenon: childbed fever, a deadly disease affecting women who had just given birth. Shockingly, as many as 10% of women delivering babies at the hospital succumbed to this illness. Among the physicians working there was Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818, who would later be hailed as a pioneer in the field of medical hygiene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Semmelweis was deeply troubled by the high mortality rates from childbed fever. Through careful observation and analysis, he hypothesised that the cause of the disease was the contaminated hands of doctors who performed autopsies and then attended to childbirths without washing their hands. Despite his compelling evidence, his contemporaries were skeptical and resistant to his pleas for handwashing. This resistance would delay the widespread adoption of this life-saving practice for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, we will re-analyse the data that led Dr. Semmelweis to his groundbreaking discovery. By examining the mortality rates before and after the implementation of handwashing, we aim to shed light on the profound impact of this simple yet revolutionary practice. Through this analysis, we hope to honor Dr. Semmelweis's legacy and underscore the critical importance of hygiene in medical settings."

    "To understand the gravity of the situation at the Vienna General Hospital during the 1840s, we begin by examining the data that made Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis realise something was terribly wrong with the hospital's procedures. Using `pandas.read_csv`, we load a dataset that contains the number of women giving birth at the hospital's two clinics between 1841 and 1846. The data reveals a shocking reality: childbirth was extremely dangerous, with a significant number of women dying as a result, primarily from childbed fever."
